# AI Car Recommender ðŸš—

A **Streamlit-based AI car recommendation app** that suggests cars based on user preferences using **OpenAI embeddings** and **FAISS** for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The AI also provides friendly explanations with pros and cons for each recommended car.

## How to run

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```


## Usage

1. Enter your car preferences in the form.  
2. Click **Find Cars**.  
3. View recommended cars displayed side-by-side.  
4. Read AI-generated explanations for each recommendation.  

## How It Works

- **Embedding Cars:** Each car entry is converted into a vector using OpenAI embeddings.  
- **FAISS Index:** Vectors are stored in a FAISS index for fast similarity search.  
- **User Query:** User preferences are converted into embeddings and used to retrieve top matches.  
- **RAG & Explanation:** The AI generates friendly recommendations using context from the retrieved cars.
